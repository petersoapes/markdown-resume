## April Peterson's CV
This is the CV for April Peterson which was branched from Sarah L. R. Stevens.  Branches are for special versions, for a specific application, generally.

### Background
Originally this used https://github.com/there4/markdown-resume to make the markdown resume.
Since then I'm just using pandoc and make to render the pdf and html versions of my resume.
So I've removed references to the old method (except for above and in the commit history)
